# This script attempts to garbage collect docker containers and images.
# Containers that exited more than an hour ago are removed.
# Images that have existed more than an hour and are not in use by any
# containers are removed.

# Note: Although docker normally prevents removal of images that are in use by
#       containers, we take extra care to not remove any image tags (e.g.
#       ubuntu:14.04, busybox, etc) that are used by containers. A naive
#       "docker rmi `docker images -q`" will leave images stripped of all tags,
#       forcing users to re-pull the repositories even though the images
#       themselves are still on disk.

# Note: State is stored in $STATE_DIR, defaulting to /var/lib/docker-gc
